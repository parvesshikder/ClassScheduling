# Introduction

First come first serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm simply schedules the jobs according to their arrival time. 
Shortest-Job-First(SJF) scheduling algorithm, schedules the processes according to their burst time.
Priority scheduling is a method of scheduling processes based on priority.


# Consideration
First come first serve (FCFS)
  1. Simple
  2. Easy
  3. First come, First serv

Shortest-Job-First(SJF)
 1. Maximum throughput 
 2. Minimum average waiting and turnaround time
 
 Priority Scheduling
  1. Easy to use scheduling method.
  2. Processes are executed on the basis of priority so high priority does not need to wait for long which saves time.

# Analysis

## FCFS
Jobs are always executed on a first-come, first-serve basis. It is easy to implement and use but this method is poor in performance, and the general wait time is quite high. While SJF process the shortest job first or shortest process next and Priority Scheduling process same Priority jobs on FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED basis


## Shortest-Job-First(SJF)

Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. While FCFS process jobs always executed on a first-come, first-serve basis and Priority Scheduling process same Priority jobs on FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED basis

## Priority Scheduling

If two jobs having the same priority are READY, it works on a FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED basis. While While FCFS process jobs always executed on a first-come, first-serve basis and SJF process the shortest job first or shortest process next.
